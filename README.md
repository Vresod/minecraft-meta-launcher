# Minecraft Meta Launcher
a Minecraft launcher launcher for people running GNU/Linux. Windows/Mac support will come later.

NOTE: None of this is final; this project is a work in progress. Many things that are claimed to happen are not implemented yet and are only planned.

## What launchers are supported?
We plan to support the vanilla minecraft-launcher, MultiMC5, [mcpelauncher-linux](https://mcpelauncher.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html), and Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.

On linux, mcpelauncher may be downloaded based on user input.

## How?
It's a CLI. Soon, it'll be in GUI form.

## What languages?
Python. Binaries can be made with nuitka.
